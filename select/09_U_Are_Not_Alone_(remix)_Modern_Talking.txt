How deep is the ocean? How deep is your love?
I have a love in my eyes
And how do I feel when you can't get enough
Half-way to your paradise
Oh, my love is your love
Forever and a day
You are not alone I'll be there for you
You are not alone anything I'll do
You are not alone you're the one for me
You are not alone that's no tragedy
You are not alone you're the one for me
You are not alone nothing comes for free
You're breaking the silence, you're breaking my heart
You're like a rose in the snow
I talk in my sleep, I don't tear apart
Baby, I'll never will go
Forever and a day
You are not alone I'll be there for you
You are not alone anything I'll do
You are not alone you're the one for me
You are not alone that's no tragedy
You are not alone you're the one for me
You are not alone nothing comes for free
You are not alone I'll be there for you
You are not alone anything I'll do
You are not alone you're the one for me
You are not alone that's no tragedy
You are not alone you're the one for me
You are not alone nothing comes for free
