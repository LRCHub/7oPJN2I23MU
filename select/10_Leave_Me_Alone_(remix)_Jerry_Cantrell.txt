Blame me, save a prayer for those
Who haunt you there now
I don't mind if you still love me

Don't come over, hear what I say
Don't come over, hear what I say
Don't come over, hear what I say
Just leave me alone, leave me alone

Shame me, hide your heart from those
Who hunt you way down
Would you care if I still need her

Don't come over, hear what I say
Don't come over, hear what I say
Don't come over, hear what I say
Just leave me alone

Save me, taken far from those
Who flaunt you, calm down
Drag your heart and you behind her

Don't come over, hear what I say
Don't come over, hear what I say
Don't come over, hear what I say
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
