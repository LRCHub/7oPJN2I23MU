With every little sip
I'm envious because
Wish I was on your lips, ooh
I'm jealous of the wind
That's running through your hair
And all over your skin

Hey, my guess is that you want that I want
And you know what I want
Hey, it's time to wrap it up, send 'em home
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby

Don't tease me
Don't leave me here alone
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
Ooh baby
Send everybody home

'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby

You've got me in the mood
So you can't blame me now
For tryna clear the room
Uh-oh, my mind is gone
'Cause I can't take my eyes
Off what you sitting on

Hey, my guess is that you want that I want
And you know what I want
Hey, it's time to wrap it up, send 'em home
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby

Don't tease me
Don't leave me here alone
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
Ooh baby
Send everybody home
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby

Don't tease me
Don't leave me here alone
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
Ooh baby
Send everybody home
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby

Don't tease me
Don't leave me here alone
'Cause I'd rather be alone with my baby
