Whine baby, gimme that pa-pa
Whine baby, gimme that pa-pa (Drust)
(Whine baby) gimme that oh-pa, oh-pa
Whine baby, gimme that pa-pa

Hit me up when you feel alone
When I see her for the village o, I fọ
With the way she dey bẹrẹ jo (oh-oh, mo je ri)
Chilalo o, chilalo
Them dey feel the rhythm for my piano, oh-ah
This music na my iyawo, iyawo, oh-oh

Seeing is believing
But still them feeling me, lo ri titi
I know you missing me
Ẹ ṣa ma miliki
Baby, ṣo tiri nisiyin, kini mi
When you on your bikini, oga
Girl, I'm losing, you cheating me
Oh jọọ, pity me (walahi)

I've had enough
Onitemi jọọ, I'm tearing up
I know I fell in love with the right one
You know my kind of love no be slight one
Ọmọde o ṣe mi mọ
See as your body plum with your stature
Ki Eledua ko mi yọ from your actions
Your I don't care attitude, nice one

Seeing is believing
But still them feeling me, lo ri titi
I know you missing me
Ẹ ṣa ma miliki
Baby, ṣo tiri nisiyin, kini mi
When you on your bikini, oga
Girl, I'm losing, you cheating me
Oh jọọ, pity me (walahi)

Kọkọ pọnmile o
Nibi ka la ju, ka dẹ pa ju de
Girl, I won't treat you bad, eh
Girl, I won't treat you bad, eh
Sweet like a party jollof
Go tie your gele tradition
To ba le bere ma ri sọ, this your condition
Ma kọ petition (this your condition)

Open pun am, make I fuck it for you
Fuck it for you, no more dulling for you
Agba baller, call me, "Joseph Yobo"
Mo ra sobo, mo dẹ fọ'ke sobo

Seeing is believing
But them feeling me, lo ri titi
I hope you missing me
Ẹ ṣa ma miliki
Baby, ṣo tiri nisiyin, kini mi
When you on your bikini, oga
Girl, I'm lo, oh-oh
Oh jọọ, pity me
Oh jọọ, pity me
