Whine baby, gimme that pumpa
Whine baby, gimme that pumpa (Boss)
Baby, gimme that bumpa, oh-pa
Whine baby, gimme that pumpa

Hit me up when you feel alone
When I see her for the village o, I fọ
With the way she dey bẹrẹ jo
(Oh-oh, mon chéri)
Chilalo o, chilalo
Them dey feel the rhythm for my piano, ah
This music na my iyawo (iyawo, oh-oh)

The seeing is believing
But still them feeling me, lo ri titi
I know you missing me
Ẹyin ẹ ṣa ma miliki
Baby, ṣo ti ri nsiyin, kini mi?
When you on your bikini
O ga
Girl, I'm losing, you cheating me
Oh jọọ, pity me (walahi)

I've had enough
Onitemi jọọ, I'm tearing up
I know I fell in love with the right one
You know my kind of love no be slight one
Ọmọde o ṣe mi mọ
See as your body plum with your stature
K'Eledua ko mi yọ from your actions
Your I don't care attitude, nice one

The seeing is believing
But still them feeling me lo ri titi
I know you missing me
Ẹyin ẹ ṣa ma miliki
Baby, ṣo tiri nisiyin, kini mi?
When you on your bikini
O ga
Girl, I'm losing, you cheating me
Oh jọọ, pity me (walahi)

Kọkọ pọn mi le o
Nibi ka la ju, ka dẹ pa ju de
Girl, I won't treat you bad, eh
Girl, I won't treat you bad, eh
Sweet like a party jollof
Go tie your gele tradition
T'ọn ba le beere ma ri sọ, this your condition
Ma kọ petition
(This your condition)

O-o-open puna, make I fuck it for you
Fuck it for you, no more dulling for you
Agba baller, call me, "Joseph Yobo"
Mo ra zobo, mo dẹ fọ'ke sobo

The seeing is believing
But still them feeling me, lo ri titi
I hope you missing me
Ẹyin ẹ ṣa ma miliki
Baby, ṣo tiri nisiyin, kini mi?
When you on your bikini
O ga
Girl, I'm- lo, oh-oh
Oh jọọ, pity me
Oh jọọ, pity me
