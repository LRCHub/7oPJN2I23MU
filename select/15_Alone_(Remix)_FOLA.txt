Whine baby give me the bumpa
Whine baby give me the bumpa
Whine baby give me the bumpa, bumpa (whine baby give me the bumpa)
Hit me up when you feel alone
When I see her for the village o, I fall
With the way she dey bere jo (oh-oh, mo je ri)
Chilalo o, chilalo
Them dey feel the rhythm for my piano, oh-ah
This music na my iyawo
Iyawo, oh-oh
Seeing is believing
But still them feeling me, lo ri titi
I know you missing me
Eh sha ma miliki
Baby, shoti tiri nisiyin, kini mi
When you on your bikini, oga
Girl, I'm losing, you cheating me
Oh joor, pity me
Walahi
I've had enough
Onitemi joor, I'm tearing up
I know I fell in love with the right one
You know my kind of love no be slight one
Omode o shey mi mo
See as your body plum with your stature
Ki eledua ko mi yo from your actions
Your I don't care attitude, nice one
Seeing is believing
But still them feeling me, lo ri titi
I know you missing me
Eh sha ma miliki
Baby, shoti tiri nisiyin, kini mi
When you on your bikini, oga
Girl, I'm losing, you cheating me
Oh joor, pity me
Walahi
Kilode to fe ma buga s'emi
Kana eleyi go trabaye you o
Brother mo ma sun'ta leni
'Cause oh baby get where she dey carry me go
Ko le le monsunmola, Jesu
The things wey you dey do, painful hm
girl I'm unstable, you say you no love me?
How will you say so?
Oh-oh I've been on my, own o
Yes I've been alone, solo
Looking for your love
I've been looking all alone
The feeling is deceiving
But I hope your listening
Lori ti ti, I heard they're missing me
Ko sha ma miliki
As you no dey respond
Girl, it's killing me
When you post on your IG
Oh God
Girl I'm
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
